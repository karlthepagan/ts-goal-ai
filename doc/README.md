#### Energy Transfers

Nodes in a network!

energy - e - energy storage
energy_norm - ce - max energy storage
energy_vel_norm - xe - normal/optimized income
energy_vel - ve - current income
energy_delta - de - current energy flow (production vs spend)
energy_time - te - time until above posture changes?
energy_time_norm - xte - normal/optimized time to fill/expend

* source
** e: it => it.energy;
** xe: it => it.energyCapacity / 300;
** ve: it => it.energy / it.ticksToRegeneration;
** de: it => undefined


* creep

* spawn / extension


#### Memory virtualization

* direct scoring for all vision sources
** backup memory for non-zero risk (TODO different prototype)

* direct scoring for all
* write-thru scoring for non-vision sources
